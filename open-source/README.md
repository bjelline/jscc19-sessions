# Open Source
### Creating and maintaining open source projects (Marc)
### Open Source Collaboration for sign language learning games (Agnes)

We mostly talked about the motivation behind starting an open source project and the relevance to market it in order to achieve your goals. Also it is important to be proud of your own work, no matter in which precise state it currently is.

## Different motivation to create an open source project
- Because it's kind of a default to build projects, starting with an open github repository.
- As a reference for yourself for future jobs.
- Giving back to the community, as we're all using a lot of open source libraries ourselves.
- Wanting collaborators for a specific project.

## Market your open source project
- Reddit or other social media
- Label your issues with "Hacktoberfest" to get more collaborators (https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/)
- Label your issues with "good first issue" or "help wanted" to get more collaborators (https://help.github.com/en/articles/helping-new-contributors-find-your-project-with-labels)
- Most importantly get more users! They are the ones finding bugs, requesting new features or even coding with you.

## Starting an open source project on the example of sign language games
Agnes brought a specific use case to ask if this might be a good open source project and how to get it started.
As a result of the discussion there now is an organization called ["Sign Together"](https://github.com/signtogether) with the purpose to be more inclusive and create games to learn some sign language vocabulary. Feel free to contribute in any way! Play one of the prototypes here: https://signtogether.github.io/DGSMemory/

- Projects in organizations attract more collaborators than private accounts.
- Make sure you have a good README and clear issues.
- Your codebase doesn't need to be polished in order to open it to other developers, just get started!
- Communication is key - talk to your users, your collaborators to discuss issues/features/...
